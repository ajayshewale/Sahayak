Artificial intelligence is a technology that makes interactions between man and machines using natural language processing. Natural language processing is a field of computer science which involves making computers derive meaning from human language and input as a way of interacting with the real world. In this project, we are addressing central problems faced by farmers, students, and citizens. Nowadays, it is straightforward to google queries on the internet, but due to the millions of search results, relevant and semantic information regarding questions are difficult to obtain. Also, there is a high demand for such problems to be on a single platform and this is what our application will provide. A simple yet effective chat bot which will suggest and provide all the relevant information about the query. Our target audience will be the most important factors of this project (mainly farmers).
